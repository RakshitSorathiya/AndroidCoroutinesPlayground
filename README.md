# Android Coroutines Playground

Example that shows a possible way of structuring the code in an Android app by making use of [Kotlin coroutines](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/reference/coroutines.html).

This is based on the stable version of coroutines.

The example is provided with both MVP and MVVM architectures (making use of Clean Architecture as well).
